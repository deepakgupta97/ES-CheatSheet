## ES-Curator with AWS S3 POC


#### Maintainer : Deepak Gupta


Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices and snapshots by: Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the actionable list. Iterate through a list of user-defined filters to progressively remove indices (or snapshots) from this actionable list as needed.



Get Started :


Install Curator on your master Node or you can keep a different server or a pod as well.
           apt/yum install python3-pip

           pip install elasticsearch-curator



      2. Curator Consist of 2 configs files importantly, one is your Curator Config and another is your actions config file where you define your customs actions need to be performed by curator. 

             to run curator : sudo curator --config <path/of/curator/config> <path/of/actions.yml>



Setup S3 Repository :     
To Setup S3 as snapshot repository, need to install S3 plugin. The command used :

      /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install repository-s3

Note : This plugin need to be installed in every node of your cluster, and then elasticsearch service need to be restarted on every node.



Now, we have to setup the snapshot repository, for that create a S3 bucket in your AWS account, and proceed with following :



Come to your master Node of ES , and register your S3 bucket as repository, but before that just add 

-Des.allow_insecure_settings=true

this to the jvm.options configuration on every node and restart the elasticsearch service.



Then, to register S3 :



curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/s3-backup" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
"type": "s3",
"settings": {
"bucket": "curator-fastag",
"region": "ap-south-1",
"access_key": "",
"secret_key": "",
"base_path": "base path of your rocket where you want to keep your snapshot"
}

}'



Here, 

s3-backup : repository name, you can give any name

curator-fastag : Bucket Name



If everything goes well this will be the response:

{
  "acknowledged" : true
}


Now you are ready “snapshotting” your Elasticsearch indices; check out the repository configuration:

curl "localhost:9200/_snapshot?pretty"

{

  "s3-backup" : {

    "type" : "s3",

    "settings" : {

      "bucket" : "curator-fastag",

      "region" : "ap-south-1",

      "base_path" : "snapshot"

    }

  }

}



Now, your S3 as snapshot repository configured.



It's time for curator to come in action : 

Bring Curator config :

# Remember, leave a key empty if there is no value.  None will be a string,

# not a Python "NoneType"

client:

  hosts:

    - <master network host IP>

  port: 9200

  url_prefix:

  use_ssl: False

  certificate:

  client_cert:

  client_key:

  ssl_no_validate: False

  http_auth:

  timeout: 30

  master_only: False



logging:

  loglevel: INFO

  logfile:

  logformat: default

  blacklist: ['elasticsearch', 'urllib3']



And, now curator action.yml :

actions:

  1:

    action: snapshot

    description: >-

      Snapshot logstash- prefixed indices older than 1 day (based on index

      creation_date) with the default snapshot name pattern of

      'curator-%Y%m%d%H%M%S'.  Wait for the snapshot to complete.  Do not skip

      the repository filesystem access check.  Use the other options to create

      the snapshot.

    options:

      repository: s3-backup   # repository name

      name:  # Leaving name blank will result in the default 'curator-%Y%m%d%H%M%S'

      ignore_unavailable: False

      include_global_state: False

      partial: False

      wait_for_completion: True

      skip_repo_fs_check: True

      timeout_override:

      continue_if_exception: False

      disable_action: False

    filters:

    - filtertype: pattern

      kind: prefix

      value: .monitoring #This value works as regex for indices, will search for monitoring indices and will create a snapshot for them, we can also give conditions here.



Now to run Curator :

sudo curator --config <path/of/curator/config> <path/of/actions.yml>



The result :
